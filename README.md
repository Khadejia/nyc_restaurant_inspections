# NYC Restaurant Health Inspections (2022–2026)

## Project Overview

An end-to-end data analytics project analyzing over 400,000 restaurant inspection records across New York City's five boroughs using PostgreSQL and Tableau. The project focuses on food safety violations, inspection grade trends, cuisine-level risk analysis, and borough-level performance within NYC's restaurant industry.

The analysis primarily focuses on inspection trends from 2022–2025, with limited inspection data available for early 2026.

This project demonstrates data cleaning, SQL analysis, KPI development, and interactive dashboard design for public health business intelligence reporting.

# Objectives

* Analyze NYC restaurant inspection trends from 2022–2026
* Identify which cuisine types and boroughs carry the highest food safety risk
* Measure the frequency of critical violations beyond what inspection grades reveal
* Compare inspection scores across cuisines, boroughs, and time periods
* Build interactive Tableau dashboards for analytical insights

---

# Tools & Technologies

* PostgreSQL
* SQL
* Tableau Public
* NYC OpenData (CSV)

# Data Pipeline & Dataset Information

This project follows a structured data pipeline from source data to a final analysis-ready dataset used in Tableau.

## Data Pipeline

Source Data → Cleaning & Standardization → Data Enrichment → Final Dataset → Tableau Visualization

---

## Source Data


* **Source:** [NYC Open Data Portal - DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/)
* **Dataset Size:** Approximately 400,000 inspection records / 26 columns
* **Timeline:** Updated continuously through 2025 (Analysis focuses primarily on 2022–2025, with limited records available for 2026)
* **Note on File Size:** Because the raw dataset exceeds 100MB, it is excluded from this repository via `.gitignore`. 

*To replicate this analysis locally, download the raw CSV from the NYC Open Data link above and place it directly into your local `data/source_data/` directory.*

---

## Final Dataset (Used in Tableau)

Located in `data/final/`:

* nyc_inspections_clean.csv

The final dataset was created by filtering, standardizing, and enriching the raw inspection data into a single analysis-ready table for SQL analysis and Tableau visualization.

Data preparation included:

* Filtering to standard Cycle Inspections only
* Retaining available 2026 inspection records for trend continuity
* Excluding complaint and pre-permit inspections
* Standardizing borough names
* Standardizing cuisine descriptions
* Creating derived date and performance metrics

---

# SQL Workflow

The SQL workflow includes:

* Table creation and schema validation
* Data import verification
* Removal of placeholder and invalid inspection records
* Date and score data type conversion
* Filtering to standard Cycle Inspections
* Borough and cuisine standardization
* Derived column creation:

  * Inspection Year
  * Inspection Month
  * Inspection Quarter
  * Score Category
  * Critical Violation Flag
* Exploratory data analysis
* KPI generation
* Tableau-ready query preparation

---

# Business Questions

* Which cuisine types have the highest average inspection scores?
* How common are critical violations compared to non-critical violations?
* Which boroughs have the highest and lowest inspection scores?
* Has the Grade A rate improved over time?
* What are the most frequently cited violations?
* Which restaurant categories present the greatest food safety risk?

---

# Key Insights

* Critical violations occur far more frequently than inspection grades alone suggest.
* Restaurants can receive a Grade A while still accumulating critical violations if the overall inspection score remains below the grading threshold.
* Cuisine type is a stronger predictor of inspection performance than borough.
* Grade A rates remained relatively stable from 2022–2026.
* Food storage, temperature control, and pest-related issues are among the most frequently cited violations.
* Manhattan restaurants achieved slightly better average inspection scores than other boroughs, though the performance gap is relatively small.
